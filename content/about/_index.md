Hi! I’m Chisa, a computer science student at Northwestern University passionate about bridging the gap between design and technology. I enjoy creating thoughtful, user-centered experiences that combine technical precision with aesthetic intuition.

### Technical Skills

- Languages: Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, SQL
- Frameworks: React, Next.js, Angular, Rails
- Tools: Git, Figma

### Beyond Tech
Outside of coding, I love dancing! I'm part of two of Northwestern's dance clubs: Refresh Dance Crew and NU K-Dance. I also love fashion and beauty.
